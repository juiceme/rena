Dogtracking extensions to Rena
==============================

This directory contains a test utility for dog tracking functionality and
implementation for the backend server for Meitrack MT-90 tracking module.

Both modules are implemented as nodejs scripts, so you need to install
node.js on your tracking backend server.


Test application
----------------

The file "test_dora.js" serves dummy coordinates to the dog tracking
application, so that you can see the positioning marker move in a circle
around the given coordinates.
For example, starting it with "node test_dora.js 60.169700 24.934800" will
start the test server to feed out coordinates that circle around the
Narinkkatori in Helsinki city center.
You can use this to verify your server and client setup works correctly
and Rena displays the moving dog marker correctly.


Server application
------------------

The file "doraserver.js" is server implementation for MT-90.
It receives coordinates from the tracking module and feeds them to the
mobile application.

Configuration is done via the file doraconfig.json;

The file contains the ports for GPS input and http clients that the
server listens to. Additionaly there is a list of imei/password pairs
that you need to configure according to your needs.

Each pair denotes a binding; the server only accepts coordinates
from devices which have teir imei present in the configuration, and
each client uses the password to access the GPS data from the device
identified by the imei.

The MT-90 uses either UDP or TCP protocol to communicate with the server.
This application uses TCP but it is easily changed to UDP if desired.
See the Meitrack GPRS protocol manual for details;

To configure your Meitrack MT-90 you can use SMS message interface.
The configuration SW that is provided with the tracking module is
of course "Windows only" but fortunately it is not needed as the
API's are all open.
See the Meitrack SMS protocol manual for details;

The interface between the server backend and the Jolla application
uses http/https query. The server application uses just http so if you
want to use https (as is preferential) you need to use a https/http
translating proxy between the internet and doraserver.
This is usually fairly easy to do, as normally you'd proxy all incoming
https requests to your network via Apache anyway.
